close to RM40,000 in a Macau scam after she was duped by a caller who told her she was involved in money laundering activities.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">Sibu OCPD Asst Comm Stanley Jonathan Ringgit said the 53-year old victim received a phone call from someone claiming to be from &quot;Pos Malaysia Kuching&quot; at about 12pm on Aug 11.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The caller claimed that she had sent a parcel to a recipient in Taman Ipoh, Perak which was now detained as it contained photocopies of identity cards of 10 individuals and an ATM card.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The line was subsequently transferred to a &quot;Sergeant Marzuki&quot;, purportedly from Ipoh police station and later to another &quot;Sergeant Wong&quot; who told her that her name had been used for money laundering activities.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">&quot;After that one &#39;Inspector Yon&#39; (supposedly) from Bukit Aman took over the line and instructed the victim to transfer all her money to an account for investigation and to make a complaint with the Audit Department,&quot; he said.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">According to ACP Stanley, the victim was told that her money would be returned on Aug 14.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">She then made four online transfers of RM39,996 to two bank accounts on Aug 12 and 13.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">When her money was not credited back into her account on Aug 14, she realised she had been cheated and lodged a police report four days later.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The term &quot;Macau Scam&quot; was coined because it is believed that it originated from Macau or that the first victims came from there. This has never been confirmed.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The scam often starts with a phone call from someone

will then claim that the potential victim owes money or has an unpaid fine, often with a very short window of less than an hour, to settle the payment or face &quot;dire consequences&quot;.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">These unsuspecting victims will then be asked to make payments to get

So with this academy, I hope we can produce world-class athletes and bring glory to Sabah and Malaysia,&quot; the 32-year-old told <em>The Star<\\/em>.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Heng has invited those interested, including those who simply want to get into a fitter lifestyle, to reach her on Facebook.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>She plans to do the training from this month onwards on weekends.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>She said so far she had received good response with many texting her to ask about the location and activities.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;I call it Anytime Strongman Academy, but the training would be at the outer compound of my house in Kolombong.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;Anyone can join regardless of age or weight because the strongman\\/strongwoman competitions are categorised according to different age and weight groups.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;For those who are really serious in doing the sport professionally, they can do weight training in my gym and then do strongman training at the academy on weekends.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;They will learn how to do all the strongman stuff such as Tyre Flip, Atlas Stone, Truck Pull, Farmer&#39;s Walk, Yoke Walk, Log Press and Car Deadlift... It is similar to a &#39;boot camp&#39; style,&quot; she explained.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Heng said that going through such training would not only develop strength and endurance, but also be beneficial for routine work and carrying heavy loads such as cooking gas cylinders.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;While the training is currently free of charge, anyone is free to chip in money as I could use such funds to get more training gear.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;My items are still limited now and I am still in the process of making some of the equipment myself,&quot; she added.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>She said apart from passion for the sport, one needed to have discipline, self-motivation and mental strength, as well as the willingness to join competitions in every few months.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>

commissioner Latheefa Koya hopes the Selangor state government will encourage all its assemblymen to make asset declarations.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;We are urging the state government to do so and it is up to the state government to discuss and debate the matter, &#39;&#39; said Latheefa.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>According to Latheefa, anyone, including elected representatives who have access to public funds, must declare their assets.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Currently, only assemblymen who are state executive councillors are required to declare their assets in Selangor, as opposed to the prerequisite in Parliament for all MPs to declare their properties and earnings.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Latheefa also said MPs must declare their assets in totality, as well as their liability and commitments.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>They have to also declare wages derived from outside sources, she said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;MPs must declare their assets in full as well as disclose the source from where it came from.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;For example, if he has a very rich uncle who dies and wills him assets, he has to declare.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;If someone gives him a gift or a donation in big amounts, he has to declare, &#39;&#39; Latheefa told a press conference after attending the Selangor state government&#39;s corruption free pledge on Monday (Aug 19).<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Latheefa said the elected representatives must declare their assets earlier on and not only after they have been hauled up by the MACC.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Earlier in her speech, Latheefa said it was worrisome that MACC data showed 46.3% out of the 4,860 individuals detained for graft from 2014 up to June this year were civil servants.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;Most of the graft cases involved staff from the procurement sector.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;It is more worrisome that 53.4% out of the 4,860 individuals detained were from the younger generation aged 40 and below,&quot; she added.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Latheefa also disclosed that a study carried out by the MACC revealed that 22.1% of the respondents, from the civil service said they were willing to receive bribes if they had power or position.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>She praised the state government&#39;s leadership for signing the pledge as it indicated their sincerity, work commitment and wish to serve in an environment which was conducive and graft free.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Meanwhile, Selangor Mentri Besar Amirudin Shari said the state was willing to look into getting its assemblymen to declare their assets like how it was being done in Parliament, if there was a need to do so.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;We are prepared to consider the matter if there is a need for it, &#39;&#39; said Amirudin.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>However, he added, a large number of the assemblymen did not wield executive powers and that is why asset declaration was only required of the executive councillors who held such powers.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Amirudin also reiterated that the state was very consistent in initiating steps to counter graft.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>According to him, executive councillors and board members attending GLC (government-linked companies), executive council and Selangor Economic Council meetings, which have big impact in terms of procurement, are required to compulsorily sign a document declaring they are not linked to the decisions that were being made.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;This practice has also been extended to the local councils, city halls and so on, &#39;&#39; said Amirudin.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>In responding to a question as to why Selangor had delayed taking the pledge until yesterday, Amirudin said the state opined there was no point of taking the pledge without putting the necessary mechanism in place.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;Now we have the mechanism and it has become a culture in our administration and management, and so we make the commitment,&quot; said Amirudin.<\\/p>\",\"article_custom_fields\":\"{\\\"\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_description\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"sponsored_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"offer_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"featured_article_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"primary_category\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"content_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"external_link\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"article_tags\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"send_to_scmp\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_flag\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"syncad_medrec_top\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"syncad_megalead\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"header\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"stop_cxense_recommendation\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"permalink\\\":[\\\"news\\\\\\/nation\\\\\\/2019\\\\\\/08\\\\\\/20\\\\\\/latheefa-hopes-selangor-govt-pushes-for-asset-declaration-among-all-its-excos\\\"],\\\"origin\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"agency\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_max_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_summary\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_end_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_start_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"branded\\\":[\\\"{\\\\\\\"is_branded\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\"],\\\"paywall_package_type\\\":[\\\"Metered\\\"],\\\"video_source\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"other_keywords\\\":[\\\"selangor

other economically, with thousands of Malaysians crossing over to the island daily for work.<br><br>\\u201cThe first to go \\u2013 should businesses in Singapore downsize their operations \\u2013 will be the thousands of Malaysians who live here but work there.<br><br>\\u201cIf their jobs are not secure, they will face problems servicing bank loans as many of them have bought houses here especially in the Iskandar Malaysia region,\\u201d he said.<br><br>He said unofficial figures showed that some 300,000 Malaysians commuted daily from Johor to work, while another 400,000 worked and lived in Singapore.<br><br>Singapore last week slashed its growth domestic product (GDP) forecast for this year from between 1.5% and 2.5% to between 0% and 1%.<br><br>The main reason for the slower growth forecast is because the Republic has been hurt badly in recent times due to the ongoing trade war between United States and China.<br><br>The situation is not helped with the global slowdown syndrome and also the current trade spate between Japan and South Korea, two Asian giants who are big entries in Singapore.<br><br>Teh said besides the possibility of banks repossessing homes, developers might also face difficulties getting Malaysians working in Singapore to buy their properties.<br><br>Singaporeans, he pointed out, were also the largest group of foreign buyers of residential homes in the country, especially in Johor Baru, adding that this might affect the high-end property segment.<br><br>\\u201cThey may also reduce their trips to Johor and spend less money on shopping, dining and visiting tourist attractions in the state,\\u2019\\u2019 Teh said.<br><br>He also added that with many Singaporean small and medium-sized businesses operating in Iskandar Malaysia, this could also hurt the country\\u2019s electronics and chemical exports.<br><br>State International Trade, Investment and Utilities Committee chairman Jimmy Puah Wee Tse agreed with Teh that the possibility of retrenchment would affect thousands of Malaysians.<br><br>The state government, he said, would double its efforts to engage and attract investors from all over the world and not only from Singapore.<br><br>\\u201cWe want to attract more Chinese companies to relocate their operations to Johor due to the ongoing US-China trade war,\\u2019\\u2019 said Puah, admitting however that with so much uncertainty, this was proving to be challenging.<br><br>\\u201cInvestors are taking up a defensive position and reviewing their investments in this region at the moment but we believe that every

female, one wildlife biologist is racing to set up a captive breeding programme for the critically-endangered Malayan Sun Bear.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Malaysia\\u2019s leading sun bear conservationist Wong Siew Te (pic) is targeting to launch the programme by 2025 at his Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Center (BSBCC) in Sandakan, Sabah.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cForest fragmentation is becoming increasingly serious, more poachers have access to forested areas and I\\u2019ve seen places that used to have lots of sun bears now no longer have any, \\u201d Wong said in an interview.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He said the empty forest syndrome was growing in Malaysia.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The extinction of sun bears, a keystone species, would have ripple effects on the survival of other wildlife and plants in the forest, he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cWithout sun bears, the forest will be very different... It is my mission to make sure that there are sun bears living in our forests, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said sun bears played an important ecological role as seed dispersals, forest engineers, forest doctors and forest farmers.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cSun bears control the termite population. In the process of eating stingless beehives, they carve holes in trees that hornbills and flying squirrels use as nests, and when they feed on earthworms, they plough the soil, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>However, poaching and deforestation are pushing sun bears to extinction. A Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia (Perhilitan) analysis estimates that there are only 300 to 500 sun bears left in Malaysia as of 2018.Its population in Sabah and Sarawak is unknown but conservationists believe there are fewer sun bears than orang utan left in the wild.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists sun bears as \\u201cVulnerable to Extinction\\u201d and it is the second rarest bear species after the giant panda. Set up in 2008, BSBCC currently runs a rehabilitation programme for rescued sun bears as well as anti-poaching, conservation, education and research activities.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said the addition of a captive breeding programme would be a holistic approach to maintaining the population of the world\\u2019s smallest bear species.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Over the past year, BSBCC has been working with the Borneo Rhino Alliance on an advanced reproductive technology project, involving collecting sun bear semen for future use and studying its reproductive biology.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong, who announced his vision for the programme during the International Congress for Conservation Biology 2019 in Kuala Lumpur, said the challenge now was to build a bear den, upgrade veterinary facilities and build capacity in reproduction biology.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>To ensure the success of the captive breeding programme, he said strict enforcement was needed to stop poaching and educating the public not to keep, kill or eat sun bears.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cIn Sabah, hunting and poaching is still ongoing.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cWe need to make sure the hunting and poaching is reduced so that we can give the sun bears a safe forest to roam when we release them, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said sun bears could not withstand human activities because they had a very slow reproductive rate, with a wild female sun bear only having an average of three to four cubs in its lifetime.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>They have a gestation period of 93 days and will stay with the cub until it reaches adulthood at around three years of age.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said BSBCC was currently housing 43 sun bears, all of which were rescued from poachers.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cWe have captive breeding in mind because if we look at the current trend, we will soon have forests with no bears. We failed with the Sumatran rhino, it should be a warning or a lesson to us, an alarm call, \\u201d he

projects would be strengthened.<br><br>The remaining three agreements reached were to give the two states authority over manpower, agriculture and forestry.<br><br>The PMO said the remaining 14 issues were expected to be decided by Aug 31.<br><br>\\u201cThis negotiation is in line with Janji 40 (40th Promise) contained in Pakatan Harapan\\u2019s manifesto,\\u201d the statement read.<br><br>The Pakatan manifesto for the 14th General Election last year contained 60 pledges which the coalition promised to fulfil in five years if voted into power.<br><br>The 40th Promise was titled \\u201cSetting up a Special Cabinet Committee to immediately review and implement the Malaysia Agreement 1963\\u201d.On the agreement regarding export duties for timber and forest products, the PMO said the matter was agreed upon and considered resolved by the Federal and Sabah governments.<br><br>On overseeing electricity and gas, it said the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry had agreed to hand over authority to oversee the distribution in Sarawak under the Sarawak Gas Distribution Ordinance 2016.<br><br>\\u201cThe Sabah government has agreed to implement due diligence is done before the handing over of the power to oversee gas and electricity,\\u201d it said.<br><br>On forging closer collaboration on projects, the PMO said the Federal, Sarawak and Sabah governments had agreed to set up a committee to strengthen collaboration in implementing federal projects.<br><br>The Federal Government agreed to set up the Special Cabinet Committee on Sept 5 last year.<br><br>The committee held its first meeting on Dec 17, receiving 21 issues for study and scrutiny.<br><br>Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad chaired its fourth meeting on July 23.<br><br>The meeting was attended by all 23 members of the committee who comprised Cabinet ministers, the Chief Ministers of Sabah and Sarawak as well as senior officers of the Federal Government and both state governments.<br><br>Although Pakatan pledged to honour the full rights of the two states, the Dewan Rakyat in April failed to meet the necessary two-thirds majority required to restore Sabah and Sarawak to its original status under MA63, which saw only 138 out of 222 lawmakers supporting the move.<br><br>On July 25, Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal, whose Parti Warisan Sabah is a Pakatan ally, said Dr Mahathir was expected to announce some good news on Sabah\\u2019s rights under MA63.<br><br>Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri James Masing, when contacted for his response, called for a new deal between Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah rather than reviewing the implementation of MA63.<br><br>He said Singapore\\u2019s withdrawal from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965 had, in his opinion, rendered MA63 null and void, as no new agreement was signed between the peninsula and two Borneo states on their union after that.<br><br>\\u201cThe so-called negotiations chaired by the Prime Minister on MA63 are equivalent to creating a supplementary agreement after Singapore\\u2019s withdrawal. If this is what the latest meeting is about, I am for it.<br><br>\\u201cLet the three territories within Malaysia make a new agreement to supersede MA63,\\u201d he said.<br><br>Masing said the freedom to sign any new deal should lie exclusively with the peninsula, Sarawak and Sabah as individual territories.<br><br>\\u201cIt will indeed be a \\u2018new Malaysia\\u2019 as coined by the Pakatan Harapan government,\\u201d he said.\",\"article_custom_fields\":\"{\\\"\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_description\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"sponsored_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"offer_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"featured_article_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"primary_category\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"content_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"external_link\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"article_tags\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"send_to_scmp\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_flag\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"syncad_medrec_top\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"syncad_megalead\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"header\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"stop_cxense_recommendation\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"permalink\\\":[\\\"news\\\\\\/nation\\\\\\/2019\\\\\\/08\\\\\\/20\\\\\\/sabah-to-administer-islands\\\"],\\\"origin\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"agency\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_max_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_summary\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_end_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_start_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"branded\\\":[\\\"{\\\\\\\"is_branded\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\"],\\\"paywall_package_type\\\":[\\\"Metered\\\"],\\\"video_source\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"other_keywords\\\":[\\\"Sabah, MA63\\\"],\\\"keyword_tagging\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"summary\\\":[\\\"PETALING JAYA: Sabah will be granted administrative powers over Pulau Sipadan and Ligitan, specifically relating to tourism, under the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63).\\\"],\\\"columnist\\\":[],\\\"byline_email\\\":[\\\"newsdesk@thestar.com.my\\\"],\\\"wide_image\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"page_number\\\":\\\"5\\\",\\\"initial_publication\\\":\\\"TheStar 2nd Edition\\\",\\\"date_created\\\":\\\"2019-08-20 07:40:23\\\",\\\"date_modified\\\":\\\"2019-08-20 08:12:12\\\",\\\"last_modified_user\\\":\\\"Norimah Binti Musa\\\",\\\"section_color\\\":\\\"#F50404\\\",\\\"cxense_metatags\\\":null,\\\"target_page\\\":\\\"5\\\"}\",\"cms_type\":\"live\",\"author_id\":0,\"section_id\":1,\"seo_meta_keywords\":\"Sabah,to,administer,islands\",\"seo_meta_description\":\"Sabah to administer islands\",\"seo_meta_title\":\"Sabah to administer islands\",\"publish_time\":\"2019-08-20 07:00:00\",\"related_articles_ids\":\"\",\"article_tags\":\"\",\"sub_section_id\":2,\"visit_count\":0,\"sponsored_flag\":0,\"offer_flag\":0,\"featured_article_flag\":0,\"media_gallery_flag\":0,\"video_gallery_flag\":0,\"highlight_flag\":0,\"top_story_flag\":0,\"is_updated\":0,\"is_old_article\":0,\"old_article_id\":0,\"article_byline\":\"By RAZAK AHMAD \\rand SHARON LING\",\"ts\":\"2019-08-20 08:12:18\",\"last_edited\":\"2019-08-20 08:12:12\",\"alt_publish_time\":\"2019-08-20 07:40:29\",\"image_path\":\"{\\\\\\\"image_path\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"uploads\\\\\\\\\\/images\\\\\\\\\\/2019\\\\\\\\\\/08\\\\\\\\\\/20\\\\\\\\\\/223031.jpg\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"cms_type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"live\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"small_image\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"is_updated\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image_cropping\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"original_image\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_original_width\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":620,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_original_height\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":413,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"icd_image_type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"original_image\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}}\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"is_copied\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"media_type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image_caption\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image_count\\\\\\\":1}\",\"author_name\":\"\",\"section_name\":\"News\",\"sub_section_name\":\"Nation\",\"slide_show\":0,\"breaking_news\":0,\"visit_count_update_date\":null,\"old_cms_article_id\":null,\"permalink\":\"news\\/nation\\/2019\\/08\\/20\\/sabah-to-administer-islands\",\"show_image_in_thumb\":0,\"ams_id\":49958,\"ams_article_id\":3034769,\"ams_country_id\":0,\"ams_section_id\":1,\"ams_subsection_id\":2,\"ams_article_date\":\"2019-08-20 00:24:00\"},{\"cms_article_id\":3034763,\"np_article_id\":90786,\"article_name\":\"mczakir190819-Eddie_90786\",\"article_title\":\"Zakir now demands an apology from four for defamation\",\"article_headline\":\"\",\"article_subtitle\":\"\",\"article_body\":\"KUALA LUMPUR: Controversial preacher Dr Zakir Naik has given Penang Deputy Chief Minister II Dr P.

Indonesia\\u2019s latest capital can be a green city, but it won\\u2019t be easy, \\u201d he said in an interview.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Roselan added that there would be \\u201cgainers and losers\\u201d if

manufacturing industries will stay behind, and this new capital will strictly be an administrative and governing centre whereby new infrastructure is planned accordingly, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Roselan said initially Sabah and Sarawak would not benefit much other than the hope of getting building contracts or orders for constructing materials.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cBut the cross-border linkages will be expedited, and so shall be the fibre-optics and 5G.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cAir linkages will be next in line and meetings with (Indonesia\\u2019s) government officials will be faster and more convenient, \\u201d said Roselan.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Roselan said all support should be given to the Indonesian government to see this happen as soon as possible.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Last week, Indonesian Consulate Tawau chief Sulistijo Djati Ismojo said Tawau district, located in Sabah\\u2019s east coast, is expected to receive the most positive impact, especially from the economic

for selection or pay the price of all the items amounting to US$14.79mil or almost RM60mil.<br><br>Lawyer Datuk David Gurupatham, who is acting on behalf of the Lebanese jewellery firm, told reporters that Rosmah had also filed another application to get an expert to verify the jewellery seized for forfeiture.<br><br>\\u201cThe defendant filed two applications on Friday, so we obviously need to

claim to reflect the present changes and the matter would also be heard on Sept 11.<br><br>He said the trial for the suit would proceed on Sept 17 as scheduled and they would be calling three

plaintiff is objecting to the amount. However, they agreed to the appointment of an independent jeweller to assess the four items,\\u201d he said.<br><br>Last Feb 14, the High Court ordered Rosmah to check and confirm in seven days the existence of the 44 pieces of jewellery that were in her possession before the seizure by police.<br><br>In its suit, Global Royalty claimed that on Feb 10, 2018, it sent 44 pieces of jewellery, including diamond necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets and tiaras, each worth between US$124,000 (RM519,183) and US$925,000 (RM3.8mil), to the defendant.<br><br>It claimed that Rosmah, in a letter dated May 22, 2018, confirmed and acknowledged receiving them but said they were no longer in her possession, and they had been confiscated and were now being kept by the Malaysian authorities.<br><br>Global Royalty is seeking a court declaration that the firm is the owner of the 44 pieces of jewellery, apart from an order that ownership of the jewellery was not transferred to the defendant.<br><br>It is also seeking a mandatory order for Rosmah to provide a list of the jewellery seized, for the jewellery to be returned or for her to pay for the jewellery. \\u2014

DAP is not the kingmaker in Pakatan Harapan as alleged by the Opposition, says Lim Guan Eng.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The DAP secretary-general said former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak had continually alleged that the DAP is the &quot;kingmaker&quot; in Pakatan, adding that the party&#39;s ministers, who are non-Muslims, had caused &quot;escalating tension&quot; among the Malays.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim said such &quot;lies were exposed when DAP did not succeed in convincing Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to close down the Lynas rare earth plant, but would continue to persuade the Prime Minister to understand the genuine concerns of environmentalists&quot;.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He added that Najib contradicted himself when he asked DAP leaders to resign for failing to close down the Lynas rare earth plant.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim, who is also Finance Minister, said in a press statement on Monday (Aug 19) that racial political tactics used by the Oppostition had reached a &quot;dangerous level&quot; following the latest issue on controversial preacher Zakir Naik.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;They hope to create a perfect chaos to see the end of Pakatan,&quot; added Lim.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He said that neither the Opposition nor the media it controls would highlight the success of the Pakatan government in recording a 4.9% economic growth in the second quarter of 2019, compared with 4.5% in the first quarter.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim said Malaysia is the only Asean country that has recorded higher economic growth in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter of the year.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He went on to say it was typical for the Opposition to resort to racist and religious extremist stereotypes, but sang a different tune when facing non-Malays and non-Muslims.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim said the Opposition&#39;s ambitions to regain power \\u2013 by playing up racial hatred and religious fears \\u2013 would not succeed as the Pakatan government was committed to adopt a rational and moderate approach towards both nation-building and handling hot-button issues.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;Furthermore, the Pakatan government is committed to listen to the people, including differing views, even when decisions are made to actively explore better alternatives.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;This is part and parcel of democracy and DAP leaders will continue to play an active part towards better decision-making that will improve democracy, public health and safety, as well as the living standards of the rakyat,&quot; said Lim.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>On Sunday (Aug 18), Dr Mahathir said the decision to allow Lynas to continue operating in the country is based on expert view, despite protests over the matter.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The premier said that the Government cannot always pander to popular views, adding that the Government had sent scientists to examine the operations in Gebeng, Pahang.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Dr Mahathir said experts found there was no danger found but some quarters insisted that the plant was dangerous.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Earlier on Sunday, anti-Lynas protestors had showed up at Taman Gelora in Kuantan to protest the Cabinet&#39;s decision to renew Lynas&#39; operating licence for another six

SAL.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Global Royalty Trading SAL sued Rosmah on June 26, 2018, seeking the return of 44 pieces of jewellery sent to her for selection or pay the price of all the items, amounting to US$14.79mil (RM60mil).<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lawyer Datuk David Gurupatham, who is acting on behalf of the Lebanese jewellery firm, told reporters that the defendant (Rosmah) also filed another application to get an expert to verify the jewellery seized for forfeiture.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;The defendant filed two applications on Friday (Aug 16), so we obviously need to respond to the applications and affidavit in reply, \\u201d he told reporters after case management in chambers before High Court Judge Wong Chee Lin.<\\/p>\\rHe said the trial for the suit will proceed on Sept 17 as scheduled and they will be calling three witnesses.\\r\\r<p>Meanwhile, lawyer Datuk Geethan Ram Vincent, who is representing Rosmah, said the defendant sought a sum of RM500, 000 as security costs and another application for an independent jeweller to assess four out of the 44 pieces of jewellery, which Rosmah alleged are now with the police.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;We are seeking a sum of RM500, 000 as security costs but the plaintiff is objecting to the amount. However, they agreed to the appointment of an independent jeweller to assess the four items, &quot; he said, adding that the defendant asked for security costs as the case involved a foreign company.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Last Feb 14, the High Court ordered Rosmah to check and confirm in seven days the existence of the 44 pieces of jewellery that were in her possession before the seizure by police.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>In its suit, Global Royalty claimed that on Feb 10, 2018, it sent 44 pieces of jewellery including diamond necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets and tiaras, each worth between US$124, 000 (RM519, 183) and US$925, 000 (RM3.8mil) to the defendant through hand-carry courier via its two agents.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The company said during delivery, Rosmah confirmed and accepted the terms, as well as conditions, in Memorandum No. 926 relating to the jewellery.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>It also claimed that Rosmah, in a letter dated May 22, 2018, also confirmed and acknowledged receiving the jewellery concerned but said all the jewellery was no longer in her possession, and they had been confiscated and were now being kept by the Malaysian authorities.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Global Royalty is seeking the court&#39;s declaration that the firm is the owner of the 44 pieces of jewellery, apart from an order that ownership of the jewellery was not transferred to the defendant.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>It is also seeking a mandatory order for Rosmah to provide a list of the jewellery seized, for the jewellery to be returned or for Rosmah to pay the price of the jewellery of US$14.79mil (RM59.83mil). -

colour\\u201d, which was posted on the Royal Johor Facebook page on Monday (Aug 19).<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said when she turned 60 a few days ago, the gifts she received from her eldest son, Tunku Mahkota Johor Tunku Ismail Ibni Sultan Ibrahim, were photographs of his three children, complete with their little palm prints and footprints.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cThese were wonderful reminders that I am now a grandmother of three! Alhamdulillah, I am blessed!<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cThose photographs are displayed on my shelves, together with the many others of my family, \\u201d she added.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said one of these photographs included one of Tunku Ismail as a baby, being held in the arms of her own maternal grandmother.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Her Majesty added that her grandmother was a Peranakan Chinese whose late brother was Tan Sri Chang Min Tat, a Malaysian Federal Court judge.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cAlthough she hardly visited us in Johor Baru, we would see her at my mother\\u2019s house every time we were in Ipoh to celebrate Hari Raya with my Perak family.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cChildren are actually - if left to their own pure and innocent thoughts, and their own understanding of the world - oblivious to racial differences. It is us - as parents - who consciously, or unconsciously, make them aware about these differences, \\u201d she said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said as a parent, she was determined to let her children know that her grandmother was Chinese, and to accept it in the same way that they know that their own paternal grandmother was English.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cI hoped that they would learn to be proud of the blood that flows through their veins, and to understand that it does not make them any less Malay, \\u201d she said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Her Majesty added that growing up, she was used to seeing her grandmother in her embroidered Nyonya kebaya and batik sarong.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said her grandmother always had a handkerchief tucked into the silver belt that held up her sarong and when she became older, and her hands started being unsteady at pinning the brooches onto the kebayas, she stopped wearing them and wore buttoned-up kebaya-like tunics and sarong instead.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cSadly, she passed on when my children were still very young. But I would always show them the photographs of her so that they will never ever forget about her.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cAt the age of sixty, I realise that there is still so much for me to learn.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>One thing I do know for sure, however, is that my Chinese grandmother was as Malaysian as I am myself. I know too that my children - even with their mixed blood heritage - are also as Malaysian as I am, \\u201d she added<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith also said that Tunku Ismail was hoping to perform the

Department,&quot; he said.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">According to ACP Stanley, the victim was told that her money would be returned on Aug 14.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">She then made four online transfers of RM39,996 to two bank accounts on Aug 12 and 13.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">When her money was not credited back into her account on Aug 14, she realised she had been cheated and lodged a police report four days later.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The case is being investigated under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The term &quot;Macau Scam&quot; was coined because it is believed that it originated from Macau or that the first victims came from there. This has never been confirmed.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The scam often starts with a phone call from someone pretending to be an officer from a bank, government agency or debt collector.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">The scammer will then claim that the potential victim owes money or has an unpaid fine, often with a very short window of less than an hour, to settle the payment or face &quot;dire consequences&quot;.<\\/span><\\/span><\\/p>\\r\\r<p><span style=\\\"color:#222222\\\"><span style=\\\"background-color:#ffffff\\\">These unsuspecting victims will then be asked to make payments to get

commissioner Latheefa Koya hopes the Selangor state government will encourage all its assemblymen to make asset declarations.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;We are urging the state government to do so and it is up to the state government to discuss and debate the matter, &#39;&#39; said Latheefa.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>According to Latheefa, anyone, including elected representatives who have access to public funds, must declare their assets.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Currently, only assemblymen who are state executive councillors are required to declare their assets in Selangor, as opposed to the prerequisite in Parliament for all MPs to declare their properties and earnings.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Latheefa also said MPs must declare their assets in totality, as well as their liability and commitments.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>They have to also declare wages derived from outside sources, she said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;MPs must declare their assets in full as well as disclose the source from where it came from.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;For example, if he has a very rich uncle who dies and wills him assets, he has to declare.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;If someone gives him a gift or a donation in big amounts, he has to declare, &#39;&#39; Latheefa told a press conference after attending the Selangor state government&#39;s corruption free pledge on Monday (Aug 19).<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Latheefa said the elected representatives must declare their assets earlier on and not only after they have been hauled up by the MACC.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Earlier in her speech, Latheefa said it was worrisome that MACC data showed 46.3% out of the 4,860 individuals detained for graft from 2014 up to June this year were civil servants.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;Most of the graft cases involved staff from the procurement sector.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;It is more worrisome that 53.4% out of the 4,860 individuals detained were from the younger generation aged 40 and below,&quot; she added.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Latheefa also disclosed that a study carried out by the MACC revealed that 22.1% of the respondents, from the civil service said they were willing to receive bribes if they had power or position.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>She praised the state government&#39;s leadership for signing the pledge as it indicated their sincerity, work commitment and wish to serve in an environment which was conducive and graft free.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Meanwhile, Selangor Mentri Besar Amirudin Shari said the state was willing to look into getting its assemblymen to declare their assets like how it was being done in Parliament, if there was a need to do so.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;We are prepared to consider the matter if there is a need for it, &#39;&#39; said Amirudin.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>However, he added, a large number of the assemblymen did not wield executive powers and that is why asset declaration was only required of the executive councillors who held such powers.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Amirudin also reiterated that the state was very consistent in initiating steps to counter graft.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>According to him, executive councillors and board members attending GLC (government-linked companies), executive council and Selangor Economic Council meetings, which have big impact in terms of procurement, are required to compulsorily sign a document declaring they are not linked to the decisions that were being made.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;This practice has also been extended to the local councils, city halls and so on, &#39;&#39; said Amirudin.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>In responding to a question as to why Selangor had delayed taking the pledge until yesterday, Amirudin said the state opined there was no point of taking the pledge without putting the necessary mechanism in place.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;Now we have the mechanism and it has become a culture in our administration and management, and so we make the commitment,&quot; said Amirudin.<\\/p>\",\"article_custom_fields\":\"{\\\"\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_description\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"sponsored_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"offer_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"featured_article_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"primary_category\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"content_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"external_link\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"article_tags\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"send_to_scmp\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_flag\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"syncad_medrec_top\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"syncad_megalead\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"header\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"stop_cxense_recommendation\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"permalink\\\":[\\\"news\\\\\\/nation\\\\\\/2019\\\\\\/08\\\\\\/20\\\\\\/latheefa-hopes-selangor-govt-pushes-for-asset-declaration-among-all-its-excos\\\"],\\\"origin\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"agency\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_max_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_summary\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_end_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_start_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"branded\\\":[\\\"{\\\\\\\"is_branded\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\"],\\\"paywall_package_type\\\":[\\\"Metered\\\"],\\\"video_source\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"other_keywords\\\":[\\\"selangor

be the thousands of Malaysians who live here but work there.<br><br>\\u201cIf their jobs are not secure, they will face problems servicing bank loans as many of them have bought houses here especially in the Iskandar Malaysia region,\\u201d he said.<br><br>He said unofficial figures showed that some 300,000 Malaysians commuted daily from Johor to work, while another 400,000 worked and lived in Singapore.<br><br>Singapore last week slashed its growth domestic product (GDP) forecast for this year from between 1.5% and 2.5% to between 0% and 1%.<br><br>The main reason for the slower growth forecast is because the Republic has been hurt badly in recent times due to the ongoing trade war between United States and China.<br><br>The situation is not helped with the global slowdown syndrome and also the current trade spate between Japan and South Korea, two Asian giants who are big entries in Singapore.<br><br>Teh said besides the possibility of banks repossessing homes, developers might also face difficulties getting Malaysians working in Singapore to buy their properties.<br><br>Singaporeans, he pointed out, were also the largest group of foreign buyers of residential homes in the country, especially in Johor Baru, adding that this might affect the high-end property segment.<br><br>\\u201cThey may also reduce their trips to Johor and spend less money on shopping, dining and visiting tourist attractions in the state,\\u2019\\u2019 Teh said.<br><br>He also added that with many Singaporean small and medium-sized businesses operating in Iskandar Malaysia, this could also hurt the country\\u2019s electronics and chemical exports.<br><br>State International Trade, Investment and Utilities Committee chairman Jimmy Puah Wee Tse agreed with Teh that the possibility of retrenchment would affect thousands of Malaysians.<br><br>The state government, he said, would double its efforts to engage and attract investors from all over the world and not only from Singapore.<br><br>\\u201cWe want to attract more Chinese companies to relocate their operations to Johor due to the ongoing US-China trade war,\\u2019\\u2019 said Puah, admitting however that with so much uncertainty, this was proving to be challenging.<br><br>\\u201cInvestors are taking up a defensive position and reviewing their investments in this region at the moment but we believe that every cloud has a silver lining.\\u201d\",\"article_custom_fields\":\"{\\\"\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_description\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"sponsored_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"offer_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"featured_article_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"primary_category\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"content_keywords\\\":[\\\"Zazali

female, one wildlife biologist is racing to set up a captive breeding programme for the critically-endangered Malayan Sun Bear.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Malaysia\\u2019s leading sun bear conservationist Wong Siew Te (pic) is targeting to launch the programme by 2025 at his Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Center (BSBCC) in Sandakan, Sabah.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cForest fragmentation is becoming increasingly serious, more poachers have access to forested areas and I\\u2019ve seen places that used to have lots of sun bears now no longer have any, \\u201d Wong said in an interview.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He said the empty forest syndrome was growing in Malaysia.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The extinction of sun bears, a keystone species, would have ripple effects on the survival of other wildlife and plants in the forest, he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cWithout sun bears, the forest will be very different... It is my mission to make sure that there are sun bears living in our forests, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said sun bears played an important ecological role as seed dispersals, forest engineers, forest doctors and forest farmers.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cSun bears control the termite population. In the process of eating stingless beehives, they carve holes in trees that hornbills and flying squirrels use as nests, and when they feed on earthworms, they plough the soil, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>However, poaching and deforestation are pushing sun bears to extinction. A Department of Wildlife and National Parks Peninsular Malaysia (Perhilitan) analysis estimates that there are only 300 to 500 sun bears left in Malaysia as of 2018.Its population in Sabah and Sarawak is unknown but conservationists believe there are fewer sun bears than orang utan left in the wild.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists sun bears as \\u201cVulnerable to Extinction\\u201d and it is the second rarest bear species after the giant panda. Set up in 2008, BSBCC currently runs a rehabilitation programme for rescued sun bears as well as anti-poaching, conservation, education and research activities.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said the addition of a captive breeding programme would be a holistic approach to maintaining the population of the world\\u2019s smallest bear species.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Over the past year, BSBCC has been working with the Borneo Rhino Alliance on an advanced reproductive technology project, involving collecting sun bear semen for future use and studying its reproductive biology.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong, who announced his vision for the programme during the International Congress for Conservation Biology 2019 in Kuala Lumpur, said the challenge now was to build a bear den, upgrade veterinary facilities and build capacity in reproduction biology.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>To ensure the success of the captive breeding programme, he said strict enforcement was needed to stop poaching and educating the public not to keep, kill or eat sun bears.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cIn Sabah, hunting and poaching is still ongoing.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cWe need to make sure the hunting and poaching is reduced so that we can give the sun bears a safe forest to roam when we release them, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said sun bears could not withstand human activities because they had a very slow reproductive rate, with a wild female sun bear only having an average of three to four cubs in its lifetime.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>They have a gestation period of 93 days and will stay with the cub until it reaches adulthood at around three years of age.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Wong said BSBCC was currently housing 43 sun bears, all of which were rescued from poachers.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cWe have captive breeding in mind because if we look at the current trend, we will soon have forests with no bears. We failed with the Sumatran rhino, it should be a warning or a lesson to us, an alarm call, \\u201d he

projects would be strengthened.<br><br>The remaining three agreements reached were to give the two states authority over manpower, agriculture and forestry.<br><br>The PMO said the remaining 14 issues were expected to be decided by Aug 31.<br><br>\\u201cThis negotiation is in line with Janji 40 (40th Promise) contained in Pakatan Harapan\\u2019s manifesto,\\u201d the statement read.<br><br>The Pakatan manifesto for the 14th General Election last year contained 60 pledges which the coalition promised to fulfil in five years if voted into power.<br><br>The 40th Promise was titled \\u201cSetting up a Special Cabinet Committee to immediately review and implement the Malaysia Agreement 1963\\u201d.On the agreement regarding export duties for timber and forest products, the PMO said the matter was agreed upon and considered resolved by the Federal and Sabah governments.<br><br>On overseeing electricity and gas, it said the Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Ministry had agreed to hand over authority to oversee the distribution in Sarawak under the Sarawak Gas Distribution Ordinance 2016.<br><br>\\u201cThe Sabah government has agreed to implement due diligence is done before the handing over of the power to oversee gas and electricity,\\u201d it said.<br><br>On forging closer collaboration on projects, the PMO said the Federal, Sarawak and Sabah governments had agreed to set up a committee to strengthen collaboration in implementing federal projects.<br><br>The Federal Government agreed to set up the Special Cabinet Committee on Sept 5 last year.<br><br>The committee held its first meeting on Dec 17, receiving 21 issues for study and scrutiny.<br><br>Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad chaired its fourth meeting on July 23.<br><br>The meeting was attended by all 23 members of the committee who comprised Cabinet ministers, the Chief Ministers of Sabah and Sarawak as well as senior officers of the Federal Government and both state governments.<br><br>Although Pakatan pledged to honour the full rights of the two states, the Dewan Rakyat in April failed to meet the necessary two-thirds majority required to restore Sabah and Sarawak to its original status under MA63, which saw only 138 out of 222 lawmakers supporting the move.<br><br>On July 25, Sabah Chief Minister Datuk Seri Mohd Shafie Apdal, whose Parti Warisan Sabah is a Pakatan ally, said Dr Mahathir was expected to announce some good news on Sabah\\u2019s rights under MA63.<br><br>Sarawak Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri James Masing, when contacted for his response, called for a new deal between Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak and Sabah rather than reviewing the implementation of MA63.<br><br>He said Singapore\\u2019s withdrawal from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965 had, in his opinion, rendered MA63 null and void, as no new agreement was signed between the peninsula and two Borneo states on their union after that.<br><br>\\u201cThe so-called negotiations chaired by the Prime Minister on MA63 are equivalent to creating a supplementary agreement after Singapore\\u2019s withdrawal. If this is what the latest meeting is about, I am for it.<br><br>\\u201cLet the three territories within Malaysia make a new agreement to supersede MA63,\\u201d he said.<br><br>Masing said the freedom to sign any new deal should lie exclusively with the peninsula, Sarawak and Sabah as individual territories.<br><br>\\u201cIt will indeed be a \\u2018new Malaysia\\u2019 as coined by the Pakatan Harapan government,\\u201d he said.\",\"article_custom_fields\":\"{\\\"\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_description\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"seo_meta_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"sponsored_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"offer_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"featured_article_flag\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"primary_category\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"content_keywords\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"external_link\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"article_tags\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"send_to_scmp\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_title\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"media_gallery_flag\\\":[\\\"off\\\"],\\\"syncad_medrec_top\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"syncad_megalead\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"header\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"stop_cxense_recommendation\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"permalink\\\":[\\\"news\\\\\\/nation\\\\\\/2019\\\\\\/08\\\\\\/20\\\\\\/sabah-to-administer-islands\\\"],\\\"origin\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"agency\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_max_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_rating\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review_summary\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"review\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_end_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news_start_time\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"breaking_news\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"branded\\\":[\\\"{\\\\\\\"is_branded\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\"}\\\"],\\\"paywall_package_type\\\":[\\\"Metered\\\"],\\\"video_source\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"other_keywords\\\":[\\\"Sabah, MA63\\\"],\\\"keyword_tagging\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"summary\\\":[\\\"PETALING JAYA: Sabah will be granted administrative powers over Pulau Sipadan and Ligitan, specifically relating to tourism, under the Malaysia Agreement 1963 (MA63).\\\"],\\\"columnist\\\":[],\\\"byline_email\\\":[\\\"newsdesk@thestar.com.my\\\"],\\\"wide_image\\\":[\\\"\\\"],\\\"page_number\\\":\\\"5\\\",\\\"initial_publication\\\":\\\"TheStar 2nd Edition\\\",\\\"date_created\\\":\\\"2019-08-20 07:40:23\\\",\\\"date_modified\\\":\\\"2019-08-20 08:12:12\\\",\\\"last_modified_user\\\":\\\"Norimah Binti Musa\\\",\\\"section_color\\\":\\\"#F50404\\\",\\\"cxense_metatags\\\":null,\\\"target_page\\\":\\\"5\\\"}\",\"cms_type\":\"live\",\"author_id\":0,\"section_id\":1,\"seo_meta_keywords\":\"Sabah,to,administer,islands\",\"seo_meta_description\":\"Sabah to administer islands\",\"seo_meta_title\":\"Sabah to administer islands\",\"publish_time\":\"2019-08-20 07:00:00\",\"related_articles_ids\":\"\",\"article_tags\":\"\",\"sub_section_id\":2,\"visit_count\":0,\"sponsored_flag\":0,\"offer_flag\":0,\"featured_article_flag\":0,\"media_gallery_flag\":0,\"video_gallery_flag\":0,\"highlight_flag\":0,\"top_story_flag\":0,\"is_updated\":0,\"is_old_article\":0,\"old_article_id\":0,\"article_byline\":\"By RAZAK AHMAD \\rand SHARON LING\",\"ts\":\"2019-08-20 08:12:18\",\"last_edited\":\"2019-08-20 08:12:12\",\"alt_publish_time\":\"2019-08-20 07:40:29\",\"image_path\":\"{\\\\\\\"image_path\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"uploads\\\\\\\\\\/images\\\\\\\\\\/2019\\\\\\\\\\/08\\\\\\\\\\/20\\\\\\\\\\/223031.jpg\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"cms_type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"live\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"small_image\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"is_updated\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image_cropping\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"original_image\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_original_width\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":620,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"image_original_height\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":413,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"icd_image_type\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"original_image\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}}\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"is_copied\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"media_type\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"0\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image_caption\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"image_count\\\\\\\":1}\",\"author_name\":\"\",\"section_name\":\"News\",\"sub_section_name\":\"Nation\",\"slide_show\":0,\"breaking_news\":0,\"visit_count_update_date\":null,\"old_cms_article_id\":null,\"permalink\":\"news\\/nation\\/2019\\/08\\/20\\/sabah-to-administer-islands\",\"show_image_in_thumb\":0,\"ams_id\":49958,\"ams_article_id\":3034769,\"ams_country_id\":0,\"ams_section_id\":1,\"ams_subsection_id\":2,\"ams_article_date\":\"2019-08-20 00:24:00\"},{\"cms_article_id\":3034763,\"np_article_id\":90786,\"article_name\":\"mczakir190819-Eddie_90786\",\"article_title\":\"Zakir now demands an apology from four for defamation\",\"article_headline\":\"\",\"article_subtitle\":\"\",\"article_body\":\"KUALA LUMPUR: Controversial preacher Dr Zakir Naik has given Penang Deputy Chief Minister II Dr P.

Indonesia\\u2019s latest capital can be a green city, but it won\\u2019t be easy, \\u201d he said in an interview.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Roselan added that there would be \\u201cgainers and losers\\u201d if

manufacturing industries will stay behind, and this new capital will strictly be an administrative and governing centre whereby new infrastructure is planned accordingly, \\u201d he said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Roselan said initially Sabah and Sarawak would not benefit much other than the hope of getting building contracts or orders for constructing materials.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cBut the cross-border linkages will be expedited, and so shall be the fibre-optics and 5G.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cAir linkages will be next in line and meetings with (Indonesia\\u2019s) government officials will be faster and more convenient, \\u201d said Roselan.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Roselan said all support should be given to the Indonesian government to see this happen as soon as possible.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Last week, Indonesian Consulate Tawau chief Sulistijo Djati Ismojo said Tawau district, located in Sabah\\u2019s east coast, is expected to receive the most positive impact, especially from the economic

for selection or pay the price of all the items amounting to US$14.79mil or almost RM60mil.<br><br>Lawyer Datuk David Gurupatham, who is acting on behalf of the Lebanese jewellery firm, told reporters that Rosmah had also filed another application to get an expert to verify the jewellery seized for forfeiture.<br><br>\\u201cThe defendant filed two applications on Friday, so we obviously need to

claim to reflect the present changes and the matter would also be heard on Sept 11.<br><br>He said the trial for the suit would proceed on Sept 17 as scheduled and they would be calling three

plaintiff is objecting to the amount. However, they agreed to the appointment of an independent jeweller to assess the four items,\\u201d he said.<br><br>Last Feb 14, the High Court ordered Rosmah to check and confirm in seven days the existence of the 44 pieces of jewellery that were in her possession before the seizure by police.<br><br>In its suit, Global Royalty claimed that on Feb 10, 2018, it sent 44 pieces of jewellery, including diamond necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets and tiaras, each worth between US$124,000 (RM519,183) and US$925,000 (RM3.8mil), to the defendant.<br><br>It claimed that Rosmah, in a letter dated May 22, 2018, confirmed and acknowledged receiving them but said they were no longer in her possession, and they had been confiscated and were now being kept by the Malaysian authorities.<br><br>Global Royalty is seeking a court declaration that the firm is the owner of the 44 pieces of jewellery, apart from an order that ownership of the jewellery was not transferred to the defendant.<br><br>It is also seeking a mandatory order for Rosmah to provide a list of the jewellery seized, for the jewellery to be returned or for her to pay for the jewellery. \\u2014

DAP is not the kingmaker in Pakatan Harapan as alleged by the Opposition, says Lim Guan Eng.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The DAP secretary-general said former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak had continually alleged that the DAP is the &quot;kingmaker&quot; in Pakatan, adding that the party&#39;s ministers, who are non-Muslims, had caused &quot;escalating tension&quot; among the Malays.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim said such &quot;lies were exposed when DAP did not succeed in convincing Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to close down the Lynas rare earth plant, but would continue to persuade the Prime Minister to understand the genuine concerns of environmentalists&quot;.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He added that Najib contradicted himself when he asked DAP leaders to resign for failing to close down the Lynas rare earth plant.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim, who is also Finance Minister, said in a press statement on Monday (Aug 19) that racial political tactics used by the Oppostition had reached a &quot;dangerous level&quot; following the latest issue on controversial preacher Zakir Naik.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;They hope to create a perfect chaos to see the end of Pakatan,&quot; added Lim.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He said that neither the Opposition nor the media it controls would highlight the success of the Pakatan government in recording a 4.9% economic growth in the second quarter of 2019, compared with 4.5% in the first quarter.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim said Malaysia is the only Asean country that has recorded higher economic growth in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter of the year.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>He went on to say it was typical for the Opposition to resort to racist and religious extremist stereotypes, but sang a different tune when facing non-Malays and non-Muslims.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lim said the Opposition&#39;s ambitions to regain power \\u2013 by playing up racial hatred and religious fears \\u2013 would not succeed as the Pakatan government was committed to adopt a rational and moderate approach towards both nation-building and handling hot-button issues.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;Furthermore, the Pakatan government is committed to listen to the people, including differing views, even when decisions are made to actively explore better alternatives.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;This is part and parcel of democracy and DAP leaders will continue to play an active part towards better decision-making that will improve democracy, public health and safety, as well as the living standards of the rakyat,&quot; said Lim.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>On Sunday (Aug 18), Dr Mahathir said the decision to allow Lynas to continue operating in the country is based on expert view, despite protests over the matter.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The premier said that the Government cannot always pander to popular views, adding that the Government had sent scientists to examine the operations in Gebeng, Pahang.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Dr Mahathir said experts found there was no danger found but some quarters insisted that the plant was dangerous.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Earlier on Sunday, anti-Lynas protestors had showed up at Taman Gelora in Kuantan to protest the Cabinet&#39;s decision to renew Lynas&#39; operating licence for another six

SAL.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Global Royalty Trading SAL sued Rosmah on June 26, 2018, seeking the return of 44 pieces of jewellery sent to her for selection or pay the price of all the items, amounting to US$14.79mil (RM60mil).<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Lawyer Datuk David Gurupatham, who is acting on behalf of the Lebanese jewellery firm, told reporters that the defendant (Rosmah) also filed another application to get an expert to verify the jewellery seized for forfeiture.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;The defendant filed two applications on Friday (Aug 16), so we obviously need to respond to the applications and affidavit in reply, \\u201d he told reporters after case management in chambers before High Court Judge Wong Chee Lin.<\\/p>\\rHe said the trial for the suit will proceed on Sept 17 as scheduled and they will be calling three witnesses.\\r\\r<p>Meanwhile, lawyer Datuk Geethan Ram Vincent, who is representing Rosmah, said the defendant sought a sum of RM500, 000 as security costs and another application for an independent jeweller to assess four out of the 44 pieces of jewellery, which Rosmah alleged are now with the police.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>&quot;We are seeking a sum of RM500, 000 as security costs but the plaintiff is objecting to the amount. However, they agreed to the appointment of an independent jeweller to assess the four items, &quot; he said, adding that the defendant asked for security costs as the case involved a foreign company.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Last Feb 14, the High Court ordered Rosmah to check and confirm in seven days the existence of the 44 pieces of jewellery that were in her possession before the seizure by police.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>In its suit, Global Royalty claimed that on Feb 10, 2018, it sent 44 pieces of jewellery including diamond necklaces, earrings, rings, bracelets and tiaras, each worth between US$124, 000 (RM519, 183) and US$925, 000 (RM3.8mil) to the defendant through hand-carry courier via its two agents.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>The company said during delivery, Rosmah confirmed and accepted the terms, as well as conditions, in Memorandum No. 926 relating to the jewellery.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>It also claimed that Rosmah, in a letter dated May 22, 2018, also confirmed and acknowledged receiving the jewellery concerned but said all the jewellery was no longer in her possession, and they had been confiscated and were now being kept by the Malaysian authorities.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Global Royalty is seeking the court&#39;s declaration that the firm is the owner of the 44 pieces of jewellery, apart from an order that ownership of the jewellery was not transferred to the defendant.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>It is also seeking a mandatory order for Rosmah to provide a list of the jewellery seized, for the jewellery to be returned or for Rosmah to pay the price of the jewellery of US$14.79mil (RM59.83mil). -

colour\\u201d, which was posted on the Royal Johor Facebook page on Monday (Aug 19).<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said when she turned 60 a few days ago, the gifts she received from her eldest son, Tunku Mahkota Johor Tunku Ismail Ibni Sultan Ibrahim, were photographs of his three children, complete with their little palm prints and footprints.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cThese were wonderful reminders that I am now a grandmother of three! Alhamdulillah, I am blessed!<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cThose photographs are displayed on my shelves, together with the many others of my family, \\u201d she added.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said one of these photographs included one of Tunku Ismail as a baby, being held in the arms of her own maternal grandmother.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Her Majesty added that her grandmother was a Peranakan Chinese whose late brother was Tan Sri Chang Min Tat, a Malaysian Federal Court judge.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cAlthough she hardly visited us in Johor Baru, we would see her at my mother\\u2019s house every time we were in Ipoh to celebrate Hari Raya with my Perak family.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cChildren are actually - if left to their own pure and innocent thoughts, and their own understanding of the world - oblivious to racial differences. It is us - as parents - who consciously, or unconsciously, make them aware about these differences, \\u201d she said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said as a parent, she was determined to let her children know that her grandmother was Chinese, and to accept it in the same way that they know that their own paternal grandmother was English.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cI hoped that they would learn to be proud of the blood that flows through their veins, and to understand that it does not make them any less Malay, \\u201d she said.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Her Majesty added that growing up, she was used to seeing her grandmother in her embroidered Nyonya kebaya and batik sarong.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith said her grandmother always had a handkerchief tucked into the silver belt that held up her sarong and when she became older, and her hands started being unsteady at pinning the brooches onto the kebayas, she stopped wearing them and wore buttoned-up kebaya-like tunics and sarong instead.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cSadly, she passed on when my children were still very young. But I would always show them the photographs of her so that they will never ever forget about her.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>\\u201cAt the age of sixty, I realise that there is still so much for me to learn.<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>One thing I do know for sure, however, is that my Chinese grandmother was as Malaysian as I am myself. I know too that my children - even with their mixed blood heritage - are also as Malaysian as I am, \\u201d she added<\\/p>\\r\\r<p>Raja Zarith also said that Tunku Ismail was hoping to perform the
